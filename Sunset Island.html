							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>
								A first person survival horror game made for the 2018 WolverineSoft Pumpkin Game Jam. 
								The main goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. You can collect resources 
								such as rocks, stones, and herbs with your axe, and trade them to the villagers in order 
								to get necessary resources and services such as lantern oil, healing, and axe sharpening. 
								However, the twist is, when night falls, monsters begin to appear. You can kill them with 
								your axe and survive the night, however, the next morning you find out that the humanoid 
								monsters that you had been killing were the villagers all along! So, you have to strike 
								a precarious balance between killing the monsters and sparing the villagers to survive for 
								as long as possible.

							<h2>WHAT WENT RIGHT</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The (at the time) new Unity Terrain System was used to great effect to create high quality 3d terrain for the island
								</li>
								<li>
									The Unity FPSController asset was used to great effect as the basis of the player controller for the game
								</li>
								<li>
									Navmesh was used to provide rudimentary but effective pathfinding for the villagers and monsters
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Git was used for version control at the beginning of development, however, several merge conflicts later, we were 
									somehow denied access from the repo that we had created, even the creator. We were forced to change to Unity Collab
								</li>
								<li>
									This was the first time I was using Unity, so I was not able to contribute as much to the core game as I would have liked to
								</li>
								<li>
									Not having enough artists resulted in programmers having to create animations via Coroutines and Translations
								</li>
								<li>
									The game was highly overscoped, resulting in almost half of the features and mechanics being cut during the development process
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Properly configure git repositories for use with Unity before starting projects
								</li>
								<li>
									Clearly assign work and make sure there are enough artists and sound designers in the team to match the scope of the game
								</li>
								<li>
									As this was my first time using Unity, I learned quite a lot about the basics of Unity, and I had a moderate understanding of how 
									to code and make games in Unity by the end of the Game Jam

							<h1 class="major">CONTRIBUTIONS</h1>
							<p>
								My major contribution to this project was the implementation of the UI and menu system. When I was implementing the menu 
								system, one major issue that came up was the player input while the game was paused. Since the orientation of the player 
								controller, which was controlled by the mouse, was not implemented using physics, it would run indepentantly of TimeScale, 
								which is how the pause menu was implemented. Several other things in the game, such as the text boxes for the villagers, 
								were also like this, and would move and change indepentantly even when the game was paused and the TimeScale was set to 0. 
								What I ended up doing to fix this was decoupling the cursor from the player controller when pause mode was entered. Also, 
								I added code to things such as the villager text boxes that insured that the code that changes the transform in relation to 
								the player would only run when the game was not in pause mode.
