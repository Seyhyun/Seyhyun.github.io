						<h3>Wwsise and AudioEvents</h3>
						<p>
							As I had not been able to work on the project much during the previous sprint, and many of the groundwork for the 
							level generation system had been done, I spent some time reviewing the code for the level generation so I could 
							begin working on it, as I was a member of the level pod. This took around 7 hours. As my first task was integrating 
							Wwize events into the level generation structure, I familiarized myself with using Wwise in Unity with by going 
							through a small tutorial and looking through the documentation. This took around 3 hours. I then began work on 
							the task itself, which was the integration of a wwise event for regional music and causing it to be posted at the 
							correct times throughout the game. This took around 6 hours.

						<h3>Destroying Unwanted Prefabs</h3>
						<p>
							The next task I was assigned was implemented code for destroying any leftover collectible and weapon objects in a 
							level when the level ended and the next one began. The current system used for finding and destroying any leftover 
							prefabs was just using GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag, and iterating through the array and deleting every object. 
							However, it is noted in comments that this is very inefficient and there should be a faster method of doing so. I 
							spent some time going through the enemy code to figure out a way to index all their drops without manually searching 
							for them, but due to the way it is done, it would be very difficult to do so, and since the DestroyUnwantedObjects 
							function is only called at the end of the level, the inefficiency is acceptable. This took around 7 hours.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="inner">
						<h3>Limitations and Future Tasks</h3>
						<p>
							I spent a significant amount of time trying to find a way to find all the enemy drops without manually searching 
							for them. This was because using FindGameObjectsWithTag was very inefficient and is even mentioned in the comments 
							of the code that destroys enemy bodies. After reviewing the code, I should have realized that it would not be feasible 
							to do so without significantly altering the enemy code, and the inefficiency would be ok since the function itself 
							would only be called at the end of a level, but I spent far too much time trying to find a workaround, and ended up 
							giving up in the end. I learned that I should quickly try to figure out if a specific aspect of a task is worth 
							spending time on before using so much time on something that only slightly affects the game.
