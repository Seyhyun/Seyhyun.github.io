							Rework of Loading Screen, Debug Toggle, Git Issues
						</p>

						<h3>Rework of Loading Screen</h3>
						<p>
							To begin, it was decided that using a Resources folder would cause building the game to take far too long, so I 
							had to rework the randomized artwork of the loading screen to use a different method. I still thought that a 
							public list would be difficult for artists to add any artwork, so after a significant amount of research, and 
							discussion with other programmers, I decided to use a new experimental feature of unity called sprite libraries. 
							It essentially is a type of asset file that can have multiple sprites added into different categories, and can be 
							referenced by other experimental components. At first, I had intended on just using the sprite library asset, and 
							getting the sprites inside it with my own code, but I quickly learned that this would be difficult as most of the 
							sprite library's functions were either internal or private. So I ended up adding a SpriteResolver, another 
							experimental component which uses a sprite library to set the sprite of a sprite renderer component on the same 
							gameobject. One issue I ran into that took me far longer to resolve than it should have is that I needed to add 
							'using UnityEngine.Experimental.U2D.Animation' to actually reference the SpriteResolver and SpriteLibrary components.
							I ended up spending more time than I should have trying to figure what had been going wrong only to figure this out 
							later.
							During this process, I ran into a issue with git, which caused over a hundred files to be changed/corrupted, and 
							after several hours of trying to troubleshoot by resetting the branch, reverting commits etc, I ended up copying what 
							work I had into a seperate folder, recloning the repo, making a new local branch, and pasting my changes back in. This 
							took around 4 hours
							In the end, I managed to get everything work, and for artists to add any new concept art in, all they had to do 
							was add it to the sprite library asset called Concept Art, which shows every image inside in the editor, making it 
							far eaiser to use than a public list. The loading screen now shows a random piece of concept art. Excluding the git 
							issues, this took around 14 hours.

						<h3>Global Debug Toggle</h3>
						<p>
							The next task I was assigned was creating a global debug toggle, and a corresponding in game console command using the 
							developer console. After familiarizing myself with how the debug text was handled in the enemies, I added a global 
							bool to the game manager that could be referenced by each enemy. Afterward, I figured out how the developer console 
							worked, and added a command that would allow the user to toggle the bool in the game manager in-game, so the debug 
							text could be turned on and off in-game. This took around 5 hours.
						</p>

						<h3>Limitations and Future Tasks</h3>
						<p>
							I spent an embarrasing amount of time trying to figure out why I was not able to get any functions or references of 
							sprite resolver and sprite library to work, when the problem was I had not added 'using UnityEngine.Experimental.U2D.Animation' 
							to the script file. I learned that I should more thorougly read the documentation and the code of any unfamiliar 
							components before I use them, even more so if they are experimental. <br>

							I am also still unsure what caused the issue with git to happen. I was lucky this time in that was able to preserve 
							most of my work, but if a problem like this happens again in the future, I might not be as lucky. I am currently 
							trying to figure out what might have went wrong, and I believe it may have to do with a pull not completing itself 
							properly due to weak internet connection, but I am still not completely sure.
