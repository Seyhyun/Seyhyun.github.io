						<h3>Getting Started and Tutorials</h3>
						<img src="images/ProjectRogue/devblog1_1.gif" class="image right" style="max-width:60%;

						<p>
							For this first sprint I cloned the git repo, and thankfully it worked without problems unlike Io last semester. 
							I then began the two assigned tutorials for programming team members. I first did the Roll a Ball tutorial. I 
							had extensive experience with the tutorial, having taught it during one of WolverineSoft's lectures a year ago, 
							and also did it for EECS 494 this semester. So, after finishing it, I added some unique features and mechanics 
							such as a double jump and doors that only unlock after certain objectives have been fullfilled. This took around 
							5 hours. The second tutorial I did was the Roll a Ball++ tutorial. This involved using the completed Roll a Ball 
							tutorial to make a simple game based on The World's Hardest Game. I followed the tutorial and was able to 
							integrate the unique mechanics I had added during the first tutorial into the game. This took around 6 hours. 
						</p>
						<br><br><br>
						<h3>Reviewing Topics</h3>
						<p>
							After finishing the tutorials I began to work on some of the recommended topics on Confluence. First I reviewed 
							ScriptableObjects. I had worked extensively with them on Io in the previous semester, so I reviewed my work and 
							thorougly reviewed the documentation. This took around 3 hours. I then began reviewing Unity's Shader Graph. I 
							had worked on Shader Graphs extensively over the summer as part of my research job at the university, so I 
							reviewed my work and read through the documentation to more thorougly understand the computations behind Unity's 
							Shader Graph system. This took around 4 hours. I was then assigned 2 tasks, adding an audioevent on level change, 
							and a portal between levels, but unfortunately, my computer broke and I was unable to complete the tasks, and was 
							unable to contribute the full 24 hours I should have.

						<h3>Limitations and Future Tasks</h3>
						<p>
							I was unable to get much actual work done during this sprint, as my computer had broken, but I will be able to 
							contribute fully starting from the next sprint, and hopefully a situation like this will not happen again.
