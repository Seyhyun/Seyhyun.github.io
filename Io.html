							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>A long term project completed over the course of a semester by around 90 University of Michigan students, Io is a
								2d action platformer with tense combat, high mobility, and difficult platforming and a final 
								boss, all utillizing the unique teloportation mechanic.</p>
							<h2>DEVELOPMENT INFO</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Developed by WolverineSoft Studio
								</li>
								<li>
									3 month development cycle (02/04/2020 - 5/04/2020)
								</li>
								<li>
									90 developers
								</li>
								<li>
									Made using Unity Engine
								</li>

							<h2>WHAT WENT RIGHT</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Developer tools creating using ScriptableObjects and Gizmos allowed for designers to design and implement attacks without having to directly
									code or work extensively alongside programmers
								</li>
								<li>
									Division of boss implementation into State Machine, Attack, and Projectiles allowed for a modular system that allowed fast prototpying and 
									creation, and the system was stable enough that it is being considered for future WolverineSoft Studio Projects
								</li>
								<li>
									Usage of Confluence Collaboration Software allowed for designers, artists, and audio engineers to easily look up documentation for assets 
									created by programmers, and prototype using them without the direction of a programmer
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Because progress was far slower than initially anticipated, severe downscoping was required, with only 2 levels left of 
									the original 6, and 1 boss instead of 2
								</li>
								<li>
									Sprint deadlines were often not meant, with tasks being worked on days after they where due, and many tasks were pushed to 
									the backlog and future sprints, causing work to pile up
								</li>
								<li>
									Playtesting, while extensive, was not done enough, resulting in game-breaking bugs in implementation being discovered very 
									late into prodcution, forcing programmers to work overtime to fix them
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Task assignment must be done with far more care, taking into consideration any unexpected circumstances that may cause them to take
									 far more time, and sprint deadlines must be enforced more strictly to avoid work piling up
								</li>
								<li>
									Extensive playtesting must be done for not only features and design, but also for any custom tools that were created for the projcet
								</li>
								<li>
									While downscoping happens during the development process of almost every game, it should be taken in consideration during preproduction 
									to prevent very large segments being removed after work has already been done

							<h1 class="major">CONTRIBUTIONS</h1>
							<p>
								My major contribution to this project was the implementation of the shop. Due to not enough time spent in 
								pre-preproduction, the shop design was revamped multiple times throughout development, sometimes even during 
								sprints. It was my job to initially implement the shop, take care of these problems and reimplement features 
								when neccessary. Initially, the player was supposed to be able to buy upgrades to their main attack in addition
								to health and extra necromancy slots. The proposal was that players would be able to pick up an attack upgrade, 
								test it out, but if they try to leave the shop without paying, the door would close and stop them from leaving.
								This was implemented within a few weeks, and the player was able to test out the new attacks. However, to the end
								of that sprint, it was decided that the player would not be able to upgrade their attack. So, that option was 
								removed, but right after the sprint, it was again decided that you would not be able to pickup items, and you 
								would simply buy items on the spot without having to pay by going up to the shopkeeper. At this point, I should
								have simply rewritten the entire shop system from scratch, as many of the features had been removed, and the 
								complicated eventsystem that was in place was entirely uneccessary. However, I decided to just use what I had 
								already created. This made it difficult to further update the shop whenever anything was added, because I had 
								to go through the system that I had implemented, instead of having a simple trigger based system. However, I did 
								end up finishing the shop, and it currently perfectly functional within the game.<br>
								During production, I learned a very important lesson, and it is that not all my work will always make into the 
								game, so I should cut my losses as soon as possible to avoid uneccessary work.
