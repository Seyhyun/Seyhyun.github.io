							Minor Bug Fixes, Game Over, and Loading Screen

						<h3>Minor Bug Fixes</h3>
						<p>
							To begin, I was notified of a small bug in my code for the function that cleaned up the scene. When I go through 
							the scene to destroy any weapons, I ended up destroying the player's weapon as well. This had not been obvious, 
							as when I had previously tested, I had only checked to see if the next level loaded. I ended up checking the 
							the parents of the weapon to see if it belonged to the player, and deleting it if not so. This took around 
							2 hours.
						</p>

						<h3>Game Over Screen</h3>
						<p>
							The next task I was assigned was creating a game over screen. The screen would display what enemy the player had 
							died to, and when clicked, would send the player back to the main menu. This was fairly difficult as I had to find 
							a way of getting the name of the enemy that had killed the player, and as the scripts are currently written, everything 
							is very compartmentalized, and I had to look for a workaround. I first had to familizarize myself with how the enemies, 
							projectiles, and player health management worked, as I needed to know how each interacted so I would be able to pull 
							the name of the enemy all the way through to the GameManger. This took around 5 hours.
							After many, many attempts, what I ended up doing was 
							adding an event listener to the player section of the EntityHealth script, and checking for when the player died. 
							I also added a variable that held the name of the last entity that hit the player, and a function that updated that 
							whenever the player was hit. I then added a function to the GameManager that would get the name of the killer from 
							the player, and pass it to the canvas that would display the game over screen, alongside other things like unlocking 
							the mouse and stopping the time. The canvas would then set itself to active, and the text on the screen would be 
							changed to say the name of the entity that killed the player. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the enemies do not 
							actually store their name anywhere, I was forced to just go with the name of the prefabs themselves, so if a prefab 
							is not named correctly, or is a temp prefab, it will just display the name of the prefab, so the enemies will have 
							to be named their actual names. This took around 12 hours.
						</p>
						<br><br><br>
						<h3>Loading Screen</h3>
						<p>
							To begin, I moved the loading text to the bottom left corner as requested. I then tried to find a way to get a 
							random image to load into the panel. After some research and tested, I decided manually adding all the images to 
							an array in the prefab itself would be too difficult, and I instead opted to use Resources.LoadAll. After some 
							tweaking, I was able to get it to work, and I also fixed the aspect ratio so the images would not stretch. I also 
							added in a white background to cover the rest of the screen if the aspect ratio was different from the game. This 
							took around 5 hours.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="inner">
						<h3>Limitations and Future Tasks</h3>
						<p>
							I spent a significant amount of time trying to find a way to find all the enemy drops without manually searching 
							for them. This was because using FindGameObjectsWithTag was very inefficient and is even mentioned in the comments 
							of the code that destroys enemy bodies. After reviewing the code, I should have realized that it would not be feasible 
							to do so without significantly altering the enemy code, and the inefficiency would be ok since the function itself 
							would only be called at the end of a level, but I spent far too much time trying to find a workaround, and ended up 
							giving up in the end. I learned that I should quickly try to figure out if a specific aspect of a task is worth 
							spending time on before using so much time on something that only slightly affects the game.
