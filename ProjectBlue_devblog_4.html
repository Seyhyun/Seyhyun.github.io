						<h3>Wall Attack Prototyping</h3>
						<p>
							The Wall attack is an attack for the final boss of the game, in which the boss swings its sword, and sends walls of crystals/
							swords flying from the right side of the screen, with a small hole that the player can jump or teleport through in order to 
							avoid damage. It was designed by a designer in the Boss Pod. After some experiementation, I decided that the easiest way 
							to create the walls was to have each wall be composed of two rectangular projectiles on the same x-coordinates, and slightly 
							apart so there would be an empty space between them. Each set of walls would have two stages, for the the first stage, they 
							would stay still beyond the screen for set amount of time, differing for each set so they would consecutively start moving, 
							and in the second stage, they would move left for a set amount of time, and despawn. Like the previous attack, it took quite 
							a while to get the timing for each of the projectiles correct. In total, this process took about 6 hours.

						<h3>Crystal Slam Attack Prototyping (Continued)</h3>
						<p>
							After prototyping the Crystal Slam Attack in the previous sprint, I was tasked with refining it after the designers made 
							several key changes to the process of the attack. Instead of the crystal spikes all coming out of the floor at one time, 
							they would start coming out of the ground consecutively starting from one side. This was done by having a seperate projectile 
							prefab for each spike. Each one would have 2 stages, where in the first stage, it would stay under the floor for a set 
							amount of time, which would be different for each prefab, and in the second stage, it would move upward out of the ground, 
							for a set amount of time, which would be the same for each prefab, and after these two stages ended, it would despawn. Like 
							the prototyping process for the previous version of the attack, it took quite a while to get the timing for each the 
							projectiles correct. There were some slight complications where I found a bug that caused the later stages of each projectile 
							from activating, which took a while to resolve, and I ended up contacting the developer of the projectile script, who fixed 
							the bug after some effort. In total, this process took about 6 hours.
							<br><br>
						</p>
						<h3>Wall Slam Attack Prototyping</h3>
						<p>
							The Wall Slam attack is an attack for the final boss of the game that combines the slam and wall attacks that were developed 
							previously. The boss first jumps up and slams into the ground and causes the spikes to come up from the ground, and then walls 
							of crystals start coming from the right of the screen. So the player will have to jump and teleport through the moving walls 
							while being unable to touch the ground because of the spikes. This attack was prototyped by using prefabs that were developed 
							for the previous two attacks, and modifiying them so they would work together. Like the other two attacks, it took quite a 
							while to get the timing for each projectile right, and since this attack is multifaceted, unlike the previous attacks, I took 
							a significant amount of time to playtest it to tweak the timing and speed to make sure the player would be able to get through 
							it. This process took around 6 hours.

						<h3>Limitations and Future Tasks</h3>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, because the animations and the assets for the boss attacks had not been implemented yet, the attacks still look 
							very unfinished when playing. For the slam attacks, the boss does not move at all and stands still because the animation for the 
							boss slaming into the floor does not exist. Also, since there are no art assets for the spikes and walls, they are currently 
							using crystal assets which are stretched to match the dimensions needed. Thankfully, the animations and assets should be ready 
							by the end of the next sprint.

						<h3>WolverineSoft Labs</h3>
						<p>
							For the WolverineSoft Labs, most teams have finished implementing all of their main mechanics, and are ready to begin the beta 
							phase, where no new assets or mechanics will be added. Several students reached out to me for instruction on Git usage, and I 
							livestreamed a short tutorial over Discord. Labs meetings are also now held over Discord, using the livestream function to show 
							any presentation slides.
